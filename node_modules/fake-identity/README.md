# fake-identity.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travishorn/fake-identity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/travishorn/fake-identity)

Generate random identity objects including name, address, etc. This may be useful if you are trying to fill your application with random personal data.

## Features

- Generates a single random identity or multiple identities in an array.
- Includes first and last names, email address, phone number, street, city, state, zip code, date of birth, sex, company, and department.
- Email address is based off of name.
- First name matches sex.
- All names, streets, and cities are commonly found in the US.
- States are weighted on population, so more populous states appear more often.
- Zip codes are loosely based on state. Zip codes are weird so it's not perfect, though.
- Date of birth will be between 18 and 60.
- Usable in the browser or Node.js.
- No dependencies.

## Installation

### Browser

Add the following to your page:

    <script src="dist/fake-identity.js"></script>
    
This will make a new global variable named `Identity` available.

### Node

Run

    npm install fake-identity

Add the following to your application:

    var Identity = require('fake-identity');

## Usage

Once installed, just use `Identity.generate()` in your scripts to get an identity object with random values. The returned object looks like this:

    {
      firstName: "Amelia",
      lastName: "Wright",
      emailAddress: "awright@example.com",
      phoneNumber: "(555) 555-0155",
      street: "7327 Central Avenue",
      city: "Oxford",
      state: "TX",
      zipCode: "75045",
      dateOfBirth: Fri Jul 20 1962 00:00:00,
      sex: "female",
      company: "Contoso Pharmaceuticals",
      department: "Legal"
    }
    
You can also pass a number to generate more than one identity. Multiple identity objects are returned in an array like so:

    Identity.generate(3);
    
    [
      {
        firstName: ...
        lastName: ...
        ...
      },
      {
        firstName: ...
        lastName: ...
        ...
      },
      {
        firstName: ...
        lastName: ...
        ...
      }
    ]
